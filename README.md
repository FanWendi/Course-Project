# Course-Project

``codebook.md`` describes all work that I performed to tidy up the raw data from the zip file **UCI HAR Dataset** 

``run_analysis.R`` does the following as described in the course project page:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

``Second_Data.text`` consists of the average of each variable for each subject and each activity, going through the process described above.
